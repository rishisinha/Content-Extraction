# Content-Extraction
Python - Extract a particular text from each row in a column.

This Function will extract a particular text from each row of a feature and if the text you are looking for is not available then it will retain the existing text as is.
If the text matches the start and end point in the function and then only that part of the sentence would be extracted.
